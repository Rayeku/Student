- Create a contener Vector2 which contain Float X and Float Y
- Create class Graph 
    - Size in Vector2 representing size of graph representation
    - list of Vector2 represents different points of the Graph


•be able to explain the decision you made over encapsulation.
•Vector2 must contain an attribute representing x and y.
•User must be allow to add a new Vector2 onto the Graph
•User must be able to output the content of the graph
    onto the console in a graph-like form
